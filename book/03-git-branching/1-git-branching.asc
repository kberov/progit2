== Разклоняване в Гит 

(((branches)))
Почти всяка СУВ има някакъв вид поддръжка на разклоняване. Разклоняване означава да се отделите от главната
посока на разработка и да продължите да работите без да се пречкате там. В много СУВ това е като цяло скъп
процес, обикновено изискващ ново копие на работната директория. Това може да отнеме доста време при големи
проекти.

Some people refer to Git's branching model as its ``killer feature,'' and it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.
Why is it so special?
The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally just as fast.
Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, even multiple times in a day.
Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a powerful and unique tool and can entirely change the way that you develop.

=== Summary

We've covered basic branching and merging in Git.
You should feel comfortable creating and switching to new branches, switching between branches and merging local branches together.
You should also be able to share your branches by pushing them to a shared server, working with others on shared branches and rebasing your branches before they are shared.
Next, we'll cover what you'll need to run your own Git repository-hosting server.
